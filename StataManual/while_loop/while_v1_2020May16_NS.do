/*
while exp {
stata commands
}

/*
Braces must be specified with while, and
1. the open brace must appear on the same line as while;
2. nothing may follow the open brace, except, of course, comments; the first command to be
executed must appear on a new line;
3. the close brace must appear on a line by itself.

* while evaluates exp and, if it is true (nonzero) , 
* repeats the process until exp evaluates to false (zero)
